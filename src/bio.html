                    In addition to exploring the solo repertoire for the bassoon, he has composed his own works for it, including a 
                    bassoon trio, “Excursions”, premiered at Arizona State University, a solo work for bassoon with piano accompaniment, 
                    “Three Psalms", and most recently works specifically for the Boulder Bassoon Quartet, including "That So Suite", 
                    "Blueish", and "Midnight Shuffle".  The BBQ premiered the first movement of the work, "So Cliche", at the IDRS convention 
                    in 2011.  A number of his works are now

                    As a member of the Boulder Bassoon Quartet, Kent has had recorded "That So Suite", and "Blueish" for the quartet's debut 
                    album, <a href="https://mkt.com/boulder-bassoon-quartet" target="_blank">"From the Opposite Shore"</a>, which also features works 
                    from innovative composers <a href="http://paulhansonmusic.com" target="_blank">Paul Hanson</a> and Dr. Rica Narimoto.

                    Also a proficient pianist, Kent has been seen occasionally performing at the piano, including two solo recitals in the 
                    mountains of Ouray County in southwestern Colorado. He was also appreciated for his piano skills within the Arizona State 
                    bassoon studio, where he was often pressed into accompaniment duties at discount rates. Kent has therefore had the unusual 
                    experience of performing both as the soloist and the accompanist of some of the standard bassoon solo works.

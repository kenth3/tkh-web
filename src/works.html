                        <strong>Fanfare</strong>
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        2018. For three bassoons and contrabassoon<br/>  
                        
                        This is a high energy fanfare with lots of movement, and a build to a rousing conclusion. I even included 
                        the word "swashbuckling" as a performance instruction.  What could possibly go wrong?<br/><br/>

                        I've always liked the idea of a bassoon quartet being able to pull off a fanfare type of piece. Hopefully 
                        this one demonstrates that. It could be a great opener for a concert or recital.<br/><br/>

                        Like the majority of my compositions latetly, this was written for my own group, the Boulder Bassoon Quartet.<br/><br/>
                        
                        The sheet music is not yet published.  If your quartet is interested in playing it, let me know on 
                        the <a href="#/contact">Contact page</a>.

                        <strong>Chorale and Fugue in the Dark</strong>
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        2018. For four bassoons<br/>  
                        
                        The idea for this came from a picture I saw of some old forest at late dusk. Looking at the image, 
                        I started thinking about the transition taking place in the picture - an idyllic and relaxing scene where 
                        the trees and a breeze blowing through was quickly becoming a scene where those same trees and breeze could 
                        take on a more sinister feeling as the darkness of evening descended.<br/><br/>

                        This picture of emotional ambiguity became the idea and central theme of the piece. Although this is not a 
                        programmatic piece, you should hear sounds that echo the idea that something that seemed beautiful and relaxing 
                        during the day could become creepy and a little scary at night.<br/><br/>

                        The fugue is in 4 parts, whose main theme is a callback to some of the "sound effects" of the chorale. 
                        I like to write contrapuntal music, but rarely apply that to the more formal structure of a fugue. 
                        Figuring out and managing the jigsaw puzzle of a fugue was an interesting exercise.<br/><br/>

                        Written for my own group, the Boulder Bassoon Quartet.<br/><br/>

                        <strong>Score for short film "ALT"</strong>
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        2016. For four bassoons<br/>  
                        Composed with fellow quartet member Brian Jack, this is sure to be the world's first all bassoon film score!  
                        A fantastic short film by Boulder film maker Adrian Bishop, this was an exciting project to contribute to.  Look 
                        for this film at film festivals around the country.<br /><br />

                        Part of the process involved multiple iterations of scenes as the movie evolved.  This resulted in a lot of music 
                        that didn't get into the movie.  I may use some of this as source material for music down the road.  Listen to the 
                        "Film Score Rejects" set above.<br /><br />

                        2012. For four bassoons<br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>I. So Cliche</em> - Energetic, rhythmic and aggressive.  Solos in the middle section to introduce 
                                each player in the quartet.  Originally completed in late 2010 as its own piece, and premiered at the 
                                IDRS conference in 2011.
                            </li>
                            <li><em>II. So So</em> - Late night jazz waltz sound. Had a mournful plungered trombone solo in my ear while 
                                writing this one.
                            </li>
                            <li><em>III. So Much For That</em> - Syncopated and contrapuntal. Mix of bluesy, and even a little funk and 
                                gospel sounds. Main theme gradually reveals itself through the chatter of the other parts in the first 
                                half. Second half changes moods, and finishes in a rollicking and jubilant coda.

                    <p>
                        1997.  For piano four hands.<br/>
                        Composed way back in 1997, this is a short piece, exploring the idea of how a slow evolution of 
                        accompaniment under a theme changes the mood of the piece.  <br/>

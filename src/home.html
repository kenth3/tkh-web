                        <strong>Boulder Bassoon Quartet Releases their Second Album, "Off the Record"</strong>
                        <br /><br />
                        The second full length album from the group of which I'm a member. The album features some great arrangements of music we've 
                        played since the beginning, like soundtracks, the Beatles, and even some 80s pop tunes.  To everyone who's asked where the 
                        CD is with all of our arrangements, here you go!
                        <br/><br />
                        To order a physical CD, <a href="https://mkt.com/boulder-bassoon-quartet" target="_blank">Head over to the quartet's web site to order your copy!</a>
                        The album is also available on any digital download store, such as

                        The BBQ reached a major milestone by celebrating their tenth anniversary on March 18, 2017.  I've had the pleasure
